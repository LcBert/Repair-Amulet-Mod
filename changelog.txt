Added black and white list to config file (repair_amulet-common.toml) to block or allow items to be repaired.

If you insert one or more items on the whitelist, the repair amulet will only repair the specified items and will not read the blacklist.
If you leave the whitelist blank, the repair amulet will only repair items that do not appear on the blacklist.
